# SQL Showcase Project

This project demonstrates SQL skills using a sample database. The project includes scripts to create tables, insert sample data, and execute complex SQL queries.

## Database Schema

The project uses a sample company database with the following tables:
- **Employees**: Stores employee details such as name, position, and department.
- **Departments**: Stores department names and locations.
- **Salaries**: Stores salary information with employee IDs and salary amounts.

## Setup Instructions

1. Run `create_tables.sql` to create the database tables.
2. Run `insert_data.sql` to populate the tables with sample data.
3. Execute `sample_queries.sql` to view complex SQL queries in action.

## Sample Queries

The `sample_queries.sql` file includes examples of:
- Multi-table joins
- Aggregate functions
- Window functions (e.g., ranking employees by salary)
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
